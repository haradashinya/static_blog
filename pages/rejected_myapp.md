title: My App has rejected.
date: 2013-02-20


My App has rejected because it doesn't use native features of Apple.

My app  crowl the website and show it (Viewer App).

However I am using UITableView in order to feel native  , it doesn't hit reviwers heart.

My reviewers say that it was better if I use push notification.
But I don't agree this advice.Because push notification drive me up a tree a tree. So I added functionality that integrate with twitter instead of follow this advice.

I hope it will go well.
